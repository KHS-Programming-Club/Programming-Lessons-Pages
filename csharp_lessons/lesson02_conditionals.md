# Week 4: Conditionals <!-- omit in toc -->

This week we're going over how to have your code make decisions. It will be able to, based on data, choose either to run something or not or between several options.

## Branches

This original concept from our [first lesson](../c_lessons/lesson00_intro_to_programming.md) is brought out of theory and into real application here: branches. This concept says, in procedural programming, a program can decide between two or more sets of operations based on a condition (aka make a decision). Here's a more technical definition from Wikipedia: 

> A branch is an instruction in a computer program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order. Branch (or branching, branched) may also refer to the act of switching execution to a different instruction sequence as a result of executing a branch instruction. Branch instructions are used to implement control flow in program loops and conditionals (i.e., executing a particular sequence of instructions only if certain conditions are satisfied).
> 
> A branch instruction can be either an unconditional branch, which always results in branching, or a conditional branch, which may or may not cause branching depending on some condition. Also, depending on how it specifies the address of the new instruction sequence (the "target" address), a branch instruction is generally classified as direct, indirect or relative, meaning that the instruction contains the target address, or it specifies where the target address is to be found (e.g., a register or memory location), or it specifies the difference between the current and target addresses. â€” **[Branch (computer science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science)), Wikipedia; Retrieved Nov 2020**

Remember this club is based on application, so this theory section is just for fun and not something you need to know. With that out of the way, let's jump into application...

## If

The `if` statement is among the most important and universal parts of programming; appearing, in some form, in pretty much every language. Though there are minor differences in syntax, the functionality is the same. All this to say this knowledge transfers well to other languages and is essential for programming.

Let's take a look at an example if statement, then break down how it works:

```
bool condition = true;

if (condition) {
  Console.WriteLine("Apparently condition is true");
}
```
